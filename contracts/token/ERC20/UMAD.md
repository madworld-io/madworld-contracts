# UMAD - MADworld’ ERC-20 Utility Token

The native ERC20 token of MAD is known as UMAD. It is also a governance token which empowers creators and collectors on MAD to vote for platform upgrades and participate in curation and moderation.

UMAD can be earned by using the MAD platform - buying and selling of NFTs, tokenizing real-world assets etc. This allows active users who value the platform most to have more governance power over it.
